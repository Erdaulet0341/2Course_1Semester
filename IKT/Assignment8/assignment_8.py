The objective of this assignment is to print the expected output.
You can find it in the instruction folder.
List of installed and authorized packages :
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn (import sklearn)
You cannot use other packages than the listed ones (except built-in default package in python).
You can write you code after this comment :

#Your code here:
import numpy as np
import sklearn.preprocessing as sk
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

input1 = [int(i) for i in input1.split(',')]
input2 = [int(i) for i in input2.split(',')]
input3 = [int(i) for i in input3.split(',')]

input1 = np.array(input1).reshape(-1,1)
input2 = np.array(input2).reshape(-1,1)
input3 = np.array(input3).reshape(-1,1)

data = np.hstack([input1, input2, input3])

data_f = sk.StandardScaler()
data_x_train = data_f.fit_transform(data)

data_x_train = data_x_train[:3] 

#use this printing (where "data_x" is your features scaled and standardized)
print("{}".format(np.round(data_x_train,2)))
